Keyboard Input
	the main input method right now is spinning the two thumbsticks on
	some kind of game controller, but you can't spin a keyboard key.

	so i was thinking:
	the left stick, horizontal, could be asdf and the right cjkl; and
	you would sort of pulse down the keys to imitate a spin. the timing
	between the presses, your acceleration per se, would determine how
	fast the line is being drawn. a-f is to the right and f-a is to the
	left. j-; is up, ;-j is down.
